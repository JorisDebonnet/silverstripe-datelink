DateLink:
# Specifies the list of child classes.
# If blank, all pages of holder_classes will be routed.
  child_classes: []
# Specify the list of holder classes.
# E.g. Add "BlogHolder" to specify dated blog entries for all children of instances of BlogHolder.
  holder_classes: []
# Default field to use for generating the date
# Individual models can override this by implementing a getRouteDate function
  default_date_field: Created
# Default value for the url pattern to use in routing
# Care must be taken when constructing this, as it must follow some exact rules:
# - $Year MUST appear somewhere as too many wildcards will cause it to match too many false positives in routing
# - This pattern is used both in routing and in building URLS for date linked pages. When building links everything
#   after the // will be cut off and have any $action appended on the end
# - The $ParentLink field will be replaced with the actual parent url both in routing and in building links
# - You can use $Year, $Month, $MonthName, $Date, $Weekday, $ParentLink, $URLSegment and constants
# - You can use #$Month and #$Date for zero-padded versions
# - All patterns before the // should end with ! to tell Silverstripe that this is a required pattern
  url_pattern: '$ParentLink!/$Year!/$Month!/$URLSegment!//$Action/$ID/$OtherID'
# Class name to use for implementation of the controller class that will handle all routed requests.
# Should be a subclass of Controller
  controller: 'DateLinkController'
# Filename used to store routing table
# This is required as database access is not accessible during routing, so these tables must be
# built during dev/build and read during page init. This will be placed under /assets
